			<h5 class="projectSubtitles">The Challenge</h5>
			<p>“The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care reports that about one in five children experience a mental health problem. In addition, approximately 70 per cent of such challenges first surface during childhood and adolescence.” </p>

			<h5 class="projectSubtitles">The Product</h5>
			<p>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a well-documented therapeutic modality that incorporates acceptance and mindfulness strategies. It has been shown to effectively foster psychological resilience for coping with several mental health issues, including: anxiety and depression. However, clinical psychologists at Etobicoke’s Trillium Health Centre reported that between sessions, many of the youth would partly forget strategies they had learned or they would fall away from practising these techniques.

			<h5 class="projectSubtitles">ACT ON THE GO</h5>

			<p>
			ACT On the Go was a prototype developed as part of a suite of Mindfulness Technologies mobile apps produced by Paula Gardner and the team at OCAD U’s Mobile Experience Lab. The suite strives to build applications that facilitate young people’s mental wellbeing through digital technologies. ACT on the Go was designed for teenagers to incorporate formal ACT sessions into mobile platforms — iOS and Android platforms. The application helps users remember and progress through key aspects of their therapy outside the hospital setting. Some features include advice on setting and assessing goals, guided meditation activities and diagnostic tools that guide users towards the most helpful activities in the application. The users were able to practice various techniques and strategies such as diffusing negative thoughts, music gaming, journalling, thought-logging and mind-body meditation.  
			</p>
			<p>
			The user experience and user interface was developed by collaborating with the Mobile Lab’s research assistants who worked with Etobicoke’s Trillium Health Centre’s ACT program to understand how potential users might be able to incorporate digital technologies into their lives. The experience relies on colours and symbols, this encourages an intuitive, visually rich, creative and playful journey for its users. Many of the youth in the ACT program were forgetting some of the strategies they had learned to set goals, diffuse anxiety, and remind themselves what matters most to them.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Mindfulness Technologies’ apps are not about measuring progress in a conventional sense,” observes Gardner. “Our goal is to offer young people encouragement and the opportunity to practise their mindfulness skills and therapeutic techniques whenever it’s convenient for them. The guiding philosophy is about giving people a tool to do their best, and to free them from conventional, often damaging self-judgement.”
