		<h5 class="projectSubtitles">The Challenge</h5>
			<p>In our increasingly interconnected world, infectious diseases pose health, security, and economic risks. At BlueDot, we integrate expertise in clinical medicine and public health with big data analytics and visualization to help decision-makers prepare for and respond to infectious diseases. Tools like BioMosaic provides analysts with situational awareness of public health threats, facilitates rapid geospatial analyses, and enables decision makers to use generated knowledge quickly and effectively.</p>

			<h5 class="projectSubtitles">The Product</h5>
			<p>In the past three years, my most impactful work involved designing products that use data to aid public health policy-making for the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and WHO (World Health Organization).</p>
			<p>
			Working at a young start-up meant I was involved in all stages of product design. I engaged in a full spectrum of design activities from ideation and product development workshops to designing from personas, collaborating with in-house subject matter experts, or collected user feedback and results from user interviews in order to iterate on small- but meaningful - features within an existing application like BioMosaic. In these instances, I gathered user requirements from stakeholders, conducted task analysis with our internal SMEs (subject-matter experts), worked on conceptual modeling, information architecture, interaction design, usability and mental model testing then worked towards the final design to hand off detailed specifications for production and development. During that process, use cases, flowcharts, design prototypes and specifications are created iteratively. Communicating conceptual ideas, detailed design and rationale were integral in this process.

		<p>As one of the first designers on BlueDot’s team, I was given the opportunity to experiment and help grow BlueDot’s internal design processes. At times, we followed a skunkworks model of rapid prototyping for testing out radically new ideas and possibilities at the company.
		</p>
		<p>
		Depending on the design problem at hand we employed and tested different design research, strategy and development methodologies. These methodologies included facilitating design thinking workshops, drawing from processes outlined in UX team of one, agile design-development methods, sprints, human-centred design toolkits, and participatory design methods.

		A highlight of my time here at BlueDot is having the pleasure of contributing to and collaborating with an extremely talented and multidisciplinary team of data engineers, software developers, subject matter experts like epidemiologists and healthcare clinicians, who were willing to participate in the design activities outlined above. Also, working at BlueDot presented unique challenges of designing for both experts in the field and the mass public. Given these opportunities at BlueDot, I have grown skills horizontally, across skill sets (user experience research, front end development, product strategy) while continuing to build vertically upon my initial strengths (interaction, visual design and rapid prototyping). I was presented with occasions to think about design at both a high level strategically and produce concrete manifestations of a designed product.
